<h1> Journal - Computer Science 1 </h1>

    Introduction/start of computer science:
    <br> 
I have learned a lot throughout the first few weeks including what html is along with many different elements and functions in the code. I started by messing around with code and learning how important details are - colons, semi-colons, commas, and quotations can completely change a code. 
year.

2/1/21 - 2/7/21
<br/>
This week I didn’t do too much however I learned how to format html into a browser page and how you can create a website out of this code. I also learned some aspects such as what a div is and elements like a header, title, and more. <br/><br/>

2/8/21 - 2/14/21<br/>
This week I finally put my website online after a lot of challenges with my terminal. I really like how my website looks as I went for more of a clean simplistic look rather than anything complicated. I also added things in a style sheet that change buttons when they are being hovered over along with many other stylistic points like a border, size of things, and others. <br/><br/>

 <br/>
This week I finalized my personal card and decided to put a manchester united logo on the front which is the soccer team I support, and a gif of a player scoring a goal on the back. I decided to pick the images/gifs because I felt they were representative of some of the things I love along with being engaging and “cool” to someone who doesn’t know much about soccer. <br/><br/>

2/22/21 - 2/28/21<br/>
This week I created my first code sketch which was composed of a ball that you could place however many times you wanted and where you wanted in a goal. This took a bit of time as I had to add an event in which when the mouse was clicked, it would create a soccer ball anywhere on the page. <br/><br/> 

3/1/21 - 3/7/21<br/>
This week I pushed my first codesketch online so it is now accessible to everyone who sees my website rather than just locally on my computer. This definitely took some time as I’m still having a little trouble navigating around the terminal on my computer. I also learned about variables and functions that I can now incorporate into my code allowing me to create more dynamic codesketches for my website.<br/><br/>
 

3/8/21 - 3/14/21<br>
Reflection up to this point: I have learned so much up to this point including how to push a website online, and many different elements I can incorporate into my code. I have learned what a function is, something that runs a task, along with an event listener, a function that is triggered by an event such as the press of a button. I have also learned what a variable is, something that stores a larger amount of data but can be referred to by one name and much more. I also learned that github was basically a “host” of your internet website and that you could plug <br/><br/>
